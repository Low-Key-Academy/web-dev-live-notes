## What is a computer?
- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
- Hard drive (Storage) - long-term
- RAM (Random Access Memory/Memory) - short-term

## What is a programming language?
Translates human-readable code into 1's and 0's for the CPU and GPU to process and output to the screen/peripheral.

For the most part, programming languages allow us to do the following:
- Remember stuff (in memory or in storage)
  - variables
  - functions
  - databases
- Do math quickly/make comparisons
  - conditionals (if/else if/else)
  - arithmetic operators (+, -, /, *)
  - comparisons (>, <, >=, <=, !==, ===)
- Do repetitive tasks over and over, quickly
  - loops (while/for)
- Helpful developer stuff
  - comments
  - logs

## Different kinds of languages
A programming language's "level" (i.e. "low-level" or "high-level") is basically determined by how far removed it is from "machine code". These general purpose languages get translated into machine code for the CPU to run.

There are a handful of different ways of translating a programming language into machine code, but to oversimplify the broad categories are interpreting vs. compiling.

## How are programming languages interpreted/compiled?
The interpreter/compiler (translator) reads the code from top to bottom, left to right and executes the instructions. The translator is looking for a specific set of keywords and characters in a specific order, each of which has its own meaning and may or may not take on different meaning with very small variations. These keywords and characters are defined by a sometimes public spec for interpreter/compiler creators to follow.
